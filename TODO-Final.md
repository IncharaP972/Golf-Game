# Install dependencies (already done)
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview
```

## 🔧 Setup Required:

1. **Firebase Project**: Your Firebase project is already configured with the provided credentials
2. **Authentication**: Enable Google Sign-in in Firebase Console
3. **Firestore**: Enable Firestore Database in Firebase Console
